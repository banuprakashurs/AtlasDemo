# AtlasDemo

Goal is to create a simple maven web project in Github, use packer to build an image of the app with tomcat and then user terraform to deploy in Google Compute Engine using Atlas all the way.

Next enhancement can be to use Consul fo rservice discovery, Vagrant to build Development images.

Current Status:

Maven project committed in github
